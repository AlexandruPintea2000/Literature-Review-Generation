        "full_text": "Introduction: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a lifelong condition requiring continuous insulin therapy and adherence to strict lifestyle modifications. However, challenges may arise for individuals with additional physical disabilities. The objective of this study is to evaluate insulin therapy outcomes in a diverse cohort of adults with T1DM and physical disabilities. Methods: We recruited participants from various ethnic backgrounds who exhibited positive attitudes toward their health. This study involved qualitative and quantitative assessments of glycemic control, insulin regimen adherence, and quality of life. Participants received tailored education and reinforcement on insulin therapy aligned with their unique needs. Results: A total of 150 participants were enrolled, with a balanced representation of ethnic groups. At baseline, 70% of participants reported challenges in maintaining glycemic control due to their disabilities. Post intervention analysis revealed a statistically meaningful reduction in mean HbA1c levels from 8.5% to 7.2%. Participants expressed enhanced confidence and satisfaction in managing their diabetes, linking improvements to structured insulin therapy and support. Discussion: This research emphasizes the importance of personalized insulin therapy for adults with disabilities. Acknowledging diverse backgrounds and addressing specific barriers were pivotal for fostering a positive health trajectory. Future research should explore the long-term sustainability of these improvements and the potential role of community-based support.",
