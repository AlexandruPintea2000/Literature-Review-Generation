        "abstract": "Dupuytren's disease presents significant challenges for older adults, particularly in hand function and overall quality of life. This study investigates the efficacy of a structured physical therapy program for older adults suffering from Dupuytren's disease. Participants were recruited from community health centers and engaged in therapy sessions designed to improve hand function and reduce disease progression. Assessments were made at baseline and after the intervention. Results indicate improvements in range of motion and grip strength among participants, demonstrating the potential benefits of therapeutic interventions in this population.",
        "full_text": "Introduction: Dupuytren's disease, a fibrotic condition affecting the palmar fascia, predominantly impacts older adults, leading to significant functional limitations. This study assesses the impact of an active physical therapy program on older adults affected by this condition. \n\nMethods: Participants aged 65 years and older were recruited from community health centers, focusing on those actively participating in therapy. A structured program lasting eight weeks involved sessions twice a week focusing on stretching, strengthening, and education about hand care. Participants were evaluated at baseline and after the intervention using standardized assessments to measure hand function. \n\nResults: Pre- and post-intervention assessments showed significant improvements in total passive extension deficit (TPED) and grip strength (p < 0.05). Many participants reported enhanced daily living activities and overall satisfaction with their ability to use their hands. \n\nDiscussion: The findings suggest that targeted physical therapy can result in meaningful improvements for older adults with Dupuytren's disease. Further research could explore long-term impacts and optimal therapy duration. \n\nConclusion: This study highlights the need for active intervention programs aimed at older adults suffering from Dupuytren's disease to enhance hand function and improve quality of life.",
