        "full_text": "Introduction: Bruising is a common concern in long-term care facilities, often signaling underlying health issues or the effects of medications. Although often overlooked, understanding the factors contributing to bruising can lead to better management approaches. This study focuses on residents in long-term care settings who are non-hospitalized and engaged in lifestyle modification programs, examining how these factors influence bruising. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving participants from three long-term care facilities. All subjects were actively involved in health advocacy programs aimed at promoting awareness and lifestyle changes. Data was collected over six months, focusing on demographics, incidence of bruising, and engagement in advocacy. Results: The analysis revealed that individuals participating in health advocacy were significantly less likely to experience bruising compared to those who were not engaged. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as increased physical activity and nutritional interventions showed promising results in reducing the severity and frequency of bruising. Discussion: The findings suggest that structured health advocacy programs can effectively empower residents, increasing their awareness of lifestyle choices that directly impact their health. Engaging patients in discussions about their health, combined with lifestyle changes, can lead to reductions in bruising occurrences. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the value of health advocacy and lifestyle modification in managing bruising within long-term care settings. Future interventions should consider incorporating these elements to enhance patient care.",
