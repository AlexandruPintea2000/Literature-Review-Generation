Secondary prevention is critical for improving long-term health outcomes. Effective strategies encompass lifestyle modifications and health literacy improvement, particularly for patients with stable mental health who are willing to commit to behavior change. This research aims to assess the impact of these interventions on secondary prevention in individuals without a history of substance abuse.\n\nMethods: We conducted a mixed-methods study targeting community-based participants with a history of MI. Participants were screened for stable mental health and assessed for their readiness to engage in lifestyle modifications. Those who met our selection criteria underwent a structured intervention program focusing on diet, physical activity, and health literacy enhancement. Follow-up was conducted through phone and email to track progress and provide ongoing support.\n\nResults: Participants exhibited marked improvements in dietary habits, physical activity levels, and self-reported understanding of heart health. The data suggests that structured follow-ups were instrumental in sustaining participant engagement and motivation for lifestyle changes. Furthermore, individuals reported increased confidence in managing their health post-intervention.\n\nDiscussion: The findings underscore the potential of targeted interventions that focus on health literacy and lifestyle alterations among MI survivors. Community-based approaches can bridge gaps in healthcare access and equip individuals with the knowledge and tools necessary for effective secondary prevention. Future studies should explore the scalability of these interventions beyond the community setting to achieve broader public health impacts.\n\nConclusion: This study reinforces the importance of lifestyle modifications and health literacy in the secondary prevention of MI. Engaging participants with stable mental health through remote follow-up strategies presents an innovative and effective method of enhancing health outcomes for individuals recovering from cardiovascular events.",
