Chronic gastroenteritis is defined as recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms persisting for more than six months, adversely affecting health and social functioning. The aim of this study is to explore how peer support groups contribute to the health management of adolescents aged 13-18 who have been diagnosed with chronic gastroenteritis for at least one year.\n\nMethods\nA qualitative approach was adopted for this study, engaging participants who attend peer support groups for gastroenteritis management. Recruitment targeted adolescents who do not follow restrictive diets and have documented treatment plans. Participants were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires aimed at understanding their experiences within the peer support framework.\n\nResults\nFindings revealed that participants felt enhanced emotional support and understanding from peers facing similar challenges. The frequency of interactions in support groups correlated with increased knowledge about their condition and improved self-management strategies. Moreover, most participants reported a better understanding of when to seek medical help, indicating that peer relationships fostered a proactive approach to health monitoring.\n\nDiscussion\nThe implications of these findings highlight the importance of considering psychosocial factors in the management of chronic gastroenteritis among adolescents. Peer support not only provides emotional relief but also encourages better engagement with treatment plans, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes. Future research should further explore these dynamics and consider interventions that leverage peer-based support for adolescent populations struggling with chronic diseases.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this study underscores the significance of peer support in the management of chronic gastroenteritis in adolescents.
