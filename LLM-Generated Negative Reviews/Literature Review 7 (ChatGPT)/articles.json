        "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of a collaborative care model on individuals diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) at community health centers. Emphasis is placed on resilience among patients and the importance of open communication about health concerns between patients, healthcare providers, and care teams. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either traditional care or a collaborative model involving healthcare workers. Results demonstrate improved health outcomes, increased patient satisfaction, and enhanced communication, highlighting the value of collaborative approaches in managing PMR. Healthcare worker perspectives on patient engagement and resilience were also evaluated.",
        "full_text": "Introduction: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory condition characterized by muscle pain and stiffness, predominantly affecting older adults. Managing PMR can be challenging, particularly in a standard care model that lacks patient engagement. The introduction of collaborative care models may provide an effective approach to improve outcomes in PMR management. This study aimed to assess how engaging patients in a collaborative care model affects their resilience, communication regarding health concerns, and overall management of PMR. Methodology: This study was conducted in community health centers where a group of volunteers diagnosed with PMR participated. Inclusion criteria required participants to demonstrate composure and adaptability, indicating resilience, along with their willingness to communicate openly with their healthcare providers about their health status. The healthcare workers who facilitated the collaborative care model were also included as subjects of the study, providing insights into the healthcare delivery process. Participants consented to randomization where one group received standard care while another received collaborative care. Results: The results indicated that participants in the collaborative care model reported significantly improved health outcomes, higher satisfaction levels, and a greater sense of being heard by their healthcare providers. Communication patterns showed that patients engaged in collaborative care exhibited openness and confidence in discussing their health concerns. Additionally, healthcare workers noted positive shifts in patient engagement and adherence to treatment recommendations within the collaborative framework. Conclusion: The findings of this study underscore the importance of collaborative care in managing polymyalgia rheumatica. By fostering resilience and enhancing communication between patients and healthcare workers, this model not only improves health outcomes but also empowers patients in their healthcare journeys. Future research should further explore the long-term implications of collaborative care in chronic disease management.",
