        "abstract": "This study aims to explore the correlation between lifestyle factors and the severity of symptoms in patients with Ménière's disease. A qualitative approach was employed to gather data from participants who maintain structured daily routines and do not smoke, thus minimizing confounding variables. The findings indicate that lifestyle modifications may play a critical role in symptom management, suggesting the need for further, more comprehensive studies in larger populations.",
        "full_text": "Ménière's disease is a complex inner ear disorder characterized by episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. This condition significantly impacts the quality of life of those affected. Understanding the factors that influence the symptoms of Ménière's disease is crucial for developing targeted treatment plans. The current research examines the lifestyle habits of a select group of patients who have committed to a structured daily routine and have no smoking history. Our sample group consisted of individuals who were dedicated to attending all scheduled sessions, mitigating potential dropouts and ensuring consistency in data collection. Through interviews and self-reported symptom diaries, we have identified key patterns in behavior that correlate with symptom relief or exacerbation. The results suggest that adherence to daily routines, including sleep hygiene, nutrition, and stress management, bears a significant relationship with the frequency and intensity of Ménière's attacks. More importantly, the avoidance of smoking, a known irritant to inner ear function, further underscores the role of lifestyle choices in this disease. Our conclusions aim to encourage healthcare providers to incorporate lifestyle guidance into the therapeutic regime for patients suffering from Ménière's disease, paving the way for holistic management approaches that prioritize both physical and psychological well-being.",
