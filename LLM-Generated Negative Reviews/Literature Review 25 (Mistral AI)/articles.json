        "full_text": "Introduction: Neck lumps are a common clinical presentation in various patient populations, but their evaluation during pregnancy requires special considerations. Hormonal shifts may influence the development and dynamics of such lesions. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of neck lumps in pregnant patients, recognize symptom changes, and document health histories relevant to treatment. Methodology: We conducted a retrospective analysis of pregnant patients presenting with neck lumps at a tertiary care facility. Participants were required to have documented treatment plans and normal-range lab results to ensure reliability. All patients were capable of recognizing changes in the size and consistency of their lumps. Results: The study cohort consisted of 50 pregnant women aged 20 to 40 years. Notably, 85% of the participants reported noticeable changes in their neck lumps, with the most common etiologies being thyroid nodules and lymphadenopathy. All subjects had a comprehensive health history documenting previous medical conditions, and lab results were consistently within normal ranges. Treatment plans were formulated based on thorough assessments, ensuring safe interventions aligning with pregnancy management protocols. Discussion: Understanding the clinical implications of neck lumps in pregnant patients is crucial for effective management. Our findings suggest the importance of recognizing symptom changes and having a documented treatment plan for favorable outcomes. Conclusion: This study highlights the necessity for ongoing education and awareness regarding neck lumps in pregnant women, focusing on the integration of tailored diagnostic and treatment approaches.",
