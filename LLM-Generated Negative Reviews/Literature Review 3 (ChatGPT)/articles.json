        "full_text": "Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a complex group of conditions affecting the temporomandibular joint and surrounding structures. In underserved populations, particularly among cancer patients, TMDs present unique challenges. The present study aims to explore these challenges through patient experiences shared in a community health clinic setting. We conducted in-depth interviews with participants who are currently undergoing treatment for cancer and have reported TMD symptoms. Participants included diverse individuals from low-income backgrounds, providing a rich landscape of experiences. Thematic analysis revealed several key areas of concern: access to care, psychosocial factors, and treatment outcomes. Participants emphasized the need for better awareness and resources tailored to their specific needs. By understanding these experiences, we aim to inform healthcare providers about the complexities affecting TMD treatment in such vulnerable populations.",
